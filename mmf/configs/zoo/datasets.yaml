# Dataset zoo defines resources for datasets
# Each leaf in zoo config defines the parameters
# to be passed to the mmf.utils.download.DownloadableFile's initialization
# arguments. A configuration for a dataset can look like
#
# [dataset_key]:
#     [variation]:
#         version: [str]
#         resources:
#            features:
#            - url:
#              file_name:
#              hashcode:
#              compressed:
#            - ...
#            images:
#            - ...
#            annotations:
#            - ...
#            extras:
#            - ...
#
# Now, if multiple variations are defined then zoo builder will look for zoo_key
# defined while initialization or it will look for the "defaults" key
#
# It is necessary to have "version" and "resources" key on the leaf.
#
# "version" key defines the version we are trying to download and it is
# needed to update files in case something is updated in the dataset.
#
# "resources" node can contain selective categories such as "features", "images" etc.
# which can be used by your dataset or MMFDatasetBuilder to selectively load files
# based on some conditions.
#
# Otherwise, a list can directly be returned under the "resources" node,
# each of which  will be passed to DownloadableFile class and will be
# initialized in build method of the MMFDatasetBuilder
